Thanks to HTML5's [`Canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element, we were able to create an implementation of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) programming in pure JavaScript.
Now with improved UI including the ability to move forward and backward in the interactive command box (AKA "CLI"), Turtle programming in JavaScript is easy enough for beginners and modifiable by advanced users thanks to its open-source nature.
